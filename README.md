# Physical-Information-Driven-and-Guided-Multimodal-Multi-task-Neural-Network
Physical Information-Driven and Guided Multimodal Multi-task Neural Network (PIMNN)

# Code Explanation:
'mutilcontrolValueAndStabilityModelUnetPINNRE.py'represents the model code of the PIMNN.

'mutilcontrolValueAndStabilityModelUnetRENonPLoss.py'represents the model code obtained 
after PIMNN removed the physical equations from the loss function.

'mutilcontrolValueAndStabilityModelUnetRENonInPhysic.py'represents the model code obtained 
after PIMNN removed the internal physical equations from the model.

'mutilcontrolValueAndStabilityModelUnetRE.py'represents the model code obtained 
after removing all the physical equations from both the internal physical equations of the PIMNN model and the loss function.

# Dataset Usage Instructions:
The compressed files in the dataset need to be fully decompressed into the directory of the dataset file.
