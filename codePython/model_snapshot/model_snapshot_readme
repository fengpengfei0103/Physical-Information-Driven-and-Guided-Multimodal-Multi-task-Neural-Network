'PINNMutilModelUnetStability_epoch_100.pth'represents the model parameters of the PIMNN training process after 100 epochs.

'NonPLossBaselineMutilModelUnetStability_epoch_100.pth'represents the model parameters obtained after PIMNN removed the physical equations from the loss function and trained for 100 epochs.

'NonInPhysicBaselineMutilModelUnetStability_epoch_100.pth'represents the model parameters obtained after PIMNN removed the internal physical equations from the model and trained for 100 epochs.

'BaselineMutilModelUnetStability_epoch_100.pth'represents the model parameters obtained after removing all the physical equations from both the internal physical equations of the PIMNN model and the loss function, and training for 100 epochs.
